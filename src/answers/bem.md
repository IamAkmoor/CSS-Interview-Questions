## What's BEM?

What is BEM? BEM is a front-end naming method for organizing and naming CSS classes. The Block, Element, Modifier methodology is a popular naming convention for class names in HTML and CSS. It helps to write clean CSS by following some simple rules.

BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) is a component-based approach to web development. The idea behind it is to divide the user interface into independent blocks. This makes interface development easy and fast even with a complex UI, and it allows reuse of existing code without copying and pasting.

Because of its unique naming scheme, we won't run into conflicts with other CSS names. BEM also provides a relationship between CSS and HTML. Ambiguous names are hard to maintain in the future‚Å£. Overall, BEM is my favourite CSS naming scheme, and I strongly suggest you try using it too!
